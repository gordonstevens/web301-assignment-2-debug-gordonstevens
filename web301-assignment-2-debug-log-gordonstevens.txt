------------
Note: According to the official NPM repo at https://www.npmjs.com/package/fsevents, this is a Mac-only package, after reading the official page and noting its functionality, this may not be a required package. Will continue with the process and keep this in mind.
------------
./node_modules and ./public appear normal

./index.js:
- Noted missing <Router> in ReactDOM.render statement, checked import statement above and checked App.js, router is intended to be implemented, added <Router><App /></Router>

./App.js:
- Changed case in import Documentation from './pages/documentation/Documentation' to import Documentation from './pages/Documentation/Documentation'
- Noted that styles.app is pointing to an empty CSS pseudo class .app, but isn't a bug so leaving it alone 

./page/:
- Renamed to ./pages/ to match up

./src/components/Card/Card.js:
- Changed import style to import styles (Using SASS)
- Added props to const Card = () => { ... becomes const Card = (props) => {
- Apparently using SASS (.scss), switched to it and VSCode validates it as SASS although it is also valid CSS
- Added export default Card; to end of file

./src/components/Header/Header.js:
- Learned about NavLink can specify multiple props RE: https://www.codementor.io/packt/using-the-link-and-navlink-components-to-navigate-to-a-route-rieqipp42
- In desktopNav <div...>, changed <NavLink exact to="/home">Home</NavLink> to <NavLink exact to="/">Home</NavLink>
- In desktopNav <div...>, changed <NavLink to="/about">Documentation</NavLink> to <NavLink to="/documentation">Documentation</NavLink> (Matches up to <Route> defined in <Switch> in App.js
- In mobileDrawerNav <div...>, checked logic and is valid 
- SASS validates as proper to VSCode
- Found Header.test.js

./src/page/Api/Api.js:
- Completely missing reference to absent SASS module yet uses <div className="api"> ...
- Changed <div className="api"> to <div> for now as SASS file isn't to be found right now
- Changed const API = () => { ... to const Api = () => { ... to match rest of project references

./src/page/Documentation/documentation.js:
- Renaming filename case to Documentation.js
- Changed import Card from '../../components/card/Card' to import Card from '../../components/Card/Card';
- Changed <div className="documentation"> to <div> for now as SASS file isn't to be found right now

./src/page/Home/Home.js:
- Changed case in import Card from '../../components/Card/card' to import Card from '../../components/Card/Card'
- Changed case in const home = () => { ... to const Home = () => { ...
- Changed <div className="home"> to <div> as there is no reference to a SASS/CSS nor any file to support a reference
- Changed <h1>You fixed the Home Page!</h2> to <h2>You fixed the Home Page!</h2>. Note that this could be an <h1> or <h2>, but I chose <h2> as more correct as it matches the other pages and SEO would
technically search engines would pick-up the <h1> in the header. Not the best setup, but SEO on an SPA is a challenge.
- Added export default Home; to end of file

yarn start
- Successful

yarn test
- Found two test suites, Header.test.js and App.test.js, both failed

./src/components/Header/Header.test.js
- Missing package enzyme, checked NPM repo and found https://www.npmjs.com/package/enzyme, read it over, seems useful if for one command in the test file
- Added import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16'; to declare adapter

yarn add enzyme
- Ignoring info about "fsevents" for now
- Package install successful

yarn test
- Found two test suites, only one failed
- Really need to declare Adapter as described

./src/components/Header/Header.test.js
- Changed import React from 'react' to import React from 'react'
- Changed import { shallow } from 'enzyme' to import Enzyme, { shallow } from 'enzyme'
- Added: import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16'; and Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() }); to declare the Adapter as described on the NPM Repo page

./src/components/Header/Header.test.js
- Added import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';
- Changed ReactDOM.render(<App />, div); to ReactDOM.render(<Router><App /></Router>, div); to include the Router into the test suite

Erased the yarn error log to start a fresh log

yarn test
- Both test suites passed successfully! All tests completed successfully.
